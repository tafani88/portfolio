<h1>Day 8 of GWC</h1>
<p>Python and Scratch have few similarites and differences. they both use variables in order to help the code process. additionally, its based off of a trial and error process. some differences include that there are no characters in python. also, scratch already has the dictionary where you can drag and pull stuff together. whereas, python you completely make up the code on your own by type or copy and pasting. 
on another note, debugging the program in python was very frustrating. i spent an hour finding out how to change the color and finally, i had found out how to do it. i felt a weight off my shoulder because it took me so long.</p>
