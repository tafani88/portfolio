<h1>Day 8 of GWC:</h1>
<p>Python and Scratch have few similarites and differences. they both use variables
in order to help the code process. additionally, its based off of a trial and error
process. some differences include that there are no characters in python. also, scratch
already has the dictionary where you can drag and pull stuff together. Whereas, python
 you completely make up the code on your own by type or copy and pasting.
on another note, debugging the program in python was very frustrating. i spent an hour
finding out how to change the color and finally, i had found out how to do it. i felt a
weight off my shoulder because it took me so long.
<h1>DAY 10 OF GWC:</h1>
 a list is basically a list of lists. it kind of describes a certain thing like a varibale
 does but it is not a variable. It's useful because it organizes your data. its very easy
 and convienant to use.I think me and Sanjana worked well together. we bounced idewas off
 of each other. Hope and Anwen understood the subject well enought o explain a few topics to
 me that we got wrong.  </p>
